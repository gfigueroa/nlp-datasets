Technology entrepreneurship that is based on high-level or applicable technology is a transformation of inventions and innovation into entrepreneurial performance through the allocation of resources in a unique way. It's an emerging hot spot in the study of entrepreneurship. Technology entrepreneurship education is an education system with the objective of developing technology entrepreneurs' competence and comprehensive quality. In this essay, a technology entrepreneurship education system that is based on interdisciplinary modularized synthesis and consistent training in and out of school is proposed with the aim of breaking through the bottleneck of current situation, and exploring an effective designing mechanism and a comprehensive quality cultivation system. This mode is tested by the practice of entrepreneurship education in Zhejiang University City College for many years. It has made great achievement since its close connection with the external network of supportive policy to college students in Hangzhou.
